            <dt>One interesting fact</dt>
            <dd>When I tried scuba diving for the first time, I thought that just putting on the diving suit would be
                enough to go into the sea. At that time, nobody noticed a child jumping into the sea. Fortunately, I
                could swim and managed to climb back up on my own.</dd>
